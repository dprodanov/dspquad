# dspquad
Quadrature for DSP

The purpose of the package is to provide routines for the 
double exponential and adpative quadrature methods in Java. 
In additon, many special functions, having integral representations are implemented.
These include

* erf

* BesselJ

* the Euler functions

* Wright function

* Zernike polynomials

* Legendre polynomials
